# Coding With Thomas: Cucumber

This is a Cucumber interpreter and engine to run cucumber tests in C/C++. 

## Disclaimer
This is my personal fun and educational project. I have read Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom and I wanted a meaningful real world example to apply the principles. I really love the idea of Cucumber and use it a lot in my projects. Therefore I decided to create a Cucumber interpreter just for the fun of it. 


## Implementation Status 

Current Status of what comes to my mind: ([x] = done)
  
scenario / scenarou outline step with beginning variable does not work! alwaays undefined..

  [ ] Rules

  [x] hooks: before, after, before scenario, after scenario 
  [x] background
  [ ] background/examples description
  [ ] undefined scenarios (proper error handling)

[ ] compiler copmpile(): quick n dirty tags which "simulate" argv
[ ] after tag with hook works for now but:
  [ ] call all hooks (all after, all begin accordingly)
  [ ] implement hooks for begin
  [ ] implment step hooks too (no tags needed)
  [ ] implement tags for scenario outline before example.


[x] adjust capacity (tables) for steps crashes with >8 steps

[ ] print file location to results
[ ] scenario outline -> variables are printed into the steps -> steps look similar in different examples
[ ] return value from run_cuke_from_argv -> return 0 if all tests pass from main
[ ] syntax error after examples table -> endless loop!
[ ] uint8_t => uint16_t (or 32?)
[x] print results (colored + overall results)
[ ] error handling invalid indices on get arg
[x] optional arg, eg. doc strings? 
[x] currently all variables are captured, skip constants in steps? 
[x] Scenario Outline after Scenario Outline does not work
