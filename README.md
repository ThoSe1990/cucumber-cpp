# CWT Cucumber

CWT Cucumber is a Cucumber interpreter and engine to run cucumber tests in C/C++. 

## Disclaimer
This is an educational project for me. I have read Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom and I want to apply these principles by scanning the document, creating bytecodes and running them in a VM. Since the original C++ Cucumber is not really supported and it's not that easy to use (build and runtime dependencies), it seemed like a useful learning project to do this. 

I have studied the Cucumber language and implemented everything to the best of my knowledge. If I missed any language features or there is something wrong, please let me know.
