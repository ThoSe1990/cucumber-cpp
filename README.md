# CWT Cucumber

CWT Cucumber is a Cucumber interpreter and engine to run cucumber tests in C/C++. 

## Disclaimer
This is my personal fun and educational project. I have read Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom and I wanted a meaningful real world example to apply the principles. I really love the idea of Cucumber and use it a lot in my projects. Therefore I decided to create a Cucumber interpreter just for the fun of it.
