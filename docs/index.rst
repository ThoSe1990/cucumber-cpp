Coding with Thomas: Cucumber - A C/C++ Cucumber Interpreter
===========================================================

Welcome to CWT-Cucumber! This is the documentation for my C/C++ Cucumber interpreter. Here you can find all information about this project, my motivation, how to use it in your projects and the source code / API documentation.

.. note::
   This is a fun and educational project for me. After reading "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom, I was looking for a good example that was not too complex.
