## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New `CWT_CUCUMBER_STEP_DELAY` environment variable to delay step execution ([32](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/32))
- Expressions `{word}` and `{}` (anonymous) implemented. Note: both are treated as `std::string` ([36](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/36))
- Skip function: `cuke::skip_scenario`. Call This function in the before hook in order to skip a scenario ([37](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/37))

### Fixed
- Tags aren't ineherited correctly, when using tag expression ([35](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/35))
- Integer and floating point types overwrite `{word}` and `{}` in examples table ([40](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/40))

### Changed 
- cuke::value::to_string uses now std::format instead of std::to_string ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Unquotet strings are onlye for anonymous `{}` possible. Every `{string}` value has to use quotes ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Type missmatches (e.g. no quotes on `{string}`) lead to an undefined step ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Stdout print in `Scenario Outline`: Values are within the step. Table prefix removed ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Internals: ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
  - Value representation is now a string: the interface in `cuke::value` is replaced with a simple string representation.
  - Step matching: Introduced regex. Each step is converted into a regex pattern
  - Scenario Outline: All steps do a search and replace for their variables.
